## Abstract
Intracellular transport is a complex process that is difficult to describe by a single general model for motion. Here, we study the transport of insulin containing vesicles, termed granules, in live MIN6 cells. We characterize how the observed heterogeneity is affected by different intracellular factors by constructing a MIN6 cell line by CRISPR-CAS9 that constitutively expresses mCherry fused to insulin and is thus packaged in granules. Confocal microscopy imaging and single particle tracking of the granule transport provide long trajectories of thousands of single granule trajectories for statistical analysis. Mean squared displacement (MSD), angle correlation distribution, and step size distribution analysis allowed identifying five distinct granule transport subpopulations, from nearly immobile and subdiffusive to run-pause and superdiffusive. The subdiffusive subpopulation recapitulates the subordinated random walk we reported earlier (Tabei, 2013; ref 18). We show that the transport characteristics of the five subpopulations have a strong dependence on the age of insulin granules. The five subpopulations also reflect the effect of local microtubule and actin networks on transport in different cellular regions. Our results provide robust metrics to clarify the heterogeneity of granule transport and demonstrate the roles of microtubule versus actin networks with granule age since initial packaging in the Golgi.
